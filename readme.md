# River Boat Hire Company Program

This Python program is designed for a river boat hire company to manage the daily operations of hiring out 10 rowing boats on the river. The program includes the following features:

1. **Calculate the Money Taken for One Boat:** The program allows you to calculate the money earned for hiring a single boat. It considers different hire rates, ensures that no boat is hired before 10:00 or returned after 17:00, and provides detailed feedback on the transaction.

2. **Find the Next Available Boat:** You can check which boats are currently available for hire at any given time. If no boats are available, it shows the earliest available time.

3. **Calculate the Money Taken for All Boats at the End of the Day:** At the end of the day, the program generates a report showing the total money earned, the total number of hours boats were hired, the number of boats that were not used that day, and which boat was used the most.
